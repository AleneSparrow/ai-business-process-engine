# Flywheel agent instructions

- Communicate with the product owner in Russian. Product UI and customer-facing copy remain English.
- `docs/sales-agent-implementation-plan-ru.md` is the source of truth for sales-agent work.
- Read `CLAUDE.md` for the product boundaries and operational rules.
- Never run `git push`; only the owner pushes.
- Do not read, request, print, or edit secrets and local `.env` files.
- Do not add a `SalesStage` or `SalesMove` without updating the sales-agent specification and transition tests.
- Do not merge `SalesStage` into `ProcessState`: the former describes conversation progress; the latter protects business commitments.
- AI output is untrusted. Validate enums, evidence, knowledge IDs, business facts, and allowed actions in server code.
- AI may analyze language and phrase an approved move. It may not set prices, grant discounts, book unchecked slots, make guarantees, or bypass `ProcessEngine`.
- Every sales claim must be grounded in an approved `knowledge_id`, `business_fact_id`, or exact customer evidence.
- Preserve tenant scope, consent, STOP suppression, human takeover, idempotency, concurrency controls, and durable outbox behavior.
- Keep changes inside the assigned file scope. Frontend tasks must not invent or change backend contracts.
- Run focused tests for the changed behavior before handoff. Do not weaken tests to accommodate an implementation.
