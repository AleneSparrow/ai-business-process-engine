# Deploying Atelier to production

This is a precise, minimal path to get the real app (not `localhost`) live on
the internet. The backend already has everything it needs (`Dockerfile`,
Alembic migrations run automatically on startup, a `/health` endpoint) — this
guide is mostly account setup and environment variables, most of which only
you can do (creating accounts and entering secrets/payment isn't something
Claude does on your behalf).

Two independent pieces, two different hosts:

- **Backend + Postgres** → [Railway](https://railway.com). Recommended
  because it deploys straight from this repo's `Dockerfile`, gives you a
  Postgres database in the same project with one click, and its Hobby plan
  ($5/mo minimum, no credit card required to start on the trial) is enough
  for an early-stage app — no separate database bill, no 30-day database
  expiry like some competitors' free tiers have.
- **Frontend (the `web/app` React app)** → [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or
  [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com). Both have a genuinely
  free, no-time-limit tier for a static site like this one, with a global CDN
  and free custom domain support. Either works; pick whichever you already
  have an account style preference for.

(Render is a fine alternative to Railway if you'd rather use it — same
`Dockerfile`-based deploy — but its free Postgres tier expires after 30 days
and its free web service tier sleeps when idle, which is a bad first
impression on a prospect visiting your own signup funnel. Not recommended for
launch, only mentioned in case you already have a Render account.)

## 1. Backend on Railway

1. Sign up at railway.com (GitHub login is the fastest option) and create a
   **New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo**, pointing at
   `AleneSparrow/ai-business-process-engine`. Railway will detect the
   `Dockerfile` automatically.
2. In the same project, click **+ New → Database → PostgreSQL**. Railway
   provisions it and exposes a `DATABASE_URL`-shaped set of variables
   automatically inside the project.
3. On the backend service, open **Variables** and set:
   - `DATABASE_URL` — reference the Postgres plugin's connection string
     (Railway lets you paste a variable reference like
     `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`, but the value must be in this app's
     expected driver format: `postgresql+psycopg://...` — if Railway's
     Postgres plugin variable comes as a plain `postgresql://...` URL,
     change the scheme prefix to `postgresql+psycopg://` before saving).
   - `APP_ENV` = `production`
   - `AI_PROVIDER` = `deterministic` to launch without any AI dependency at
     all (qualification and booking are deterministic either way; this only
     turns off AI-assisted intake wording), or `openai` if you want that —
     if `openai`, also set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your own key **directly in
     Railway's Variables tab**, not by giving it to Claude.
   - `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` — leave a placeholder for now
     (`https://placeholder.example`); you'll come back and set this to your
     real frontend URL in step 3. The app refuses to start in production
     with a wildcard (`*`) here, and refuses every browser request from an
     origin not explicitly listed — so this has to be exact.
   - `LOG_LEVEL` = `INFO` (optional, this is already the default)
4. Deploy. Railway builds the Docker image, runs `alembic upgrade head`, then
   starts the app (see the `Dockerfile` — this is automatic, nothing to run
   by hand). Once it's live, Railway shows a public URL like
   `https://your-service.up.railway.app` — note it, the frontend needs it.
5. Generate a custom domain later from the service's **Settings → Networking**
   if you want `api.yourdomain.com` instead of the railway.app subdomain.

## 2. Frontend on Vercel (or Cloudflare Pages)

1. Sign up, **Add New Project**, import the same GitHub repo.
2. Set the project root to `web/app` (Vercel/Cloudflare both let you point a
   project at a subdirectory of a monorepo).
3. Build command: `npm run build`. Output directory: `dist`.
4. Environment variable: `VITE_API_BASE` = the Railway backend URL from step
   1.4 above (e.g. `https://your-service.up.railway.app`).
5. Deploy. You'll get a URL like `https://your-app.vercel.app` (or a
   `.pages.dev` one on Cloudflare) — note it too.

## 3. Connect them

Go back to the Railway backend's **Variables** and set the real
`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the frontend URL from step 2.5 (comma-separate if
you also want to allow a custom domain once you set one up, e.g.
`https://your-app.vercel.app,https://app.yourdomain.com`). Save — Railway
redeploys automatically on a variable change.

## 4. Billing (Lemon Squeezy) — required before a real customer can subscribe

Self-serve billing (`src/persistence/billing_service.py`) is fully built and
wired in, but it's off until you do the account-side setup below — with no
`LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY` set, the backend boots fine and everything else works,
but billing endpoints return a clear "not configured" error instead of a
crash. Account creation and entering the secret keys are things only you can
do.

Runs on **Lemon Squeezy**, not Stripe — Stripe's supported-country list
doesn't include Vietnam. Lemon Squeezy is a Merchant of Record (it's the
legal seller on every transaction and handles sales-tax/VAT compliance
itself), and it explicitly supports Vietnam-based sellers for payouts. The
fee is higher than Stripe's (5% + $0.50/transaction vs. Stripe's ~2.9% +
$0.30) — a deliberate tradeoff for Vietnam eligibility plus not having to
handle tax compliance yourself.

1. Sign up at [lemonsqueezy.com](https://lemonsqueezy.com) and create a
   **Store** (Settings → Stores) — this is where you'll set your payout bank
   account (Vietnamese bank account works here). New stores start in **Test
   mode** (a toggle in Store settings) so you can go through the whole flow
   below before charging real cards.
2. **Products → New product**, twice:
   - **Starter** — subscription, **$199.00/month**.
   - **Pro** — subscription, **$499.00/month**.
   For each product's variant, open **Subscription options** and set the
   **free trial** to **7 days** — this is configured here in the dashboard,
   not passed by the app per-checkout (unlike Stripe). If you ever change
   this number, also update `BILLING_TRIAL_DAYS` below and the "Start 7-day
   free trial" copy in `web/app/src/pages/Billing.tsx` — the app doesn't
   read the trial length back from Lemon Squeezy, it's copy-only there.
   Copy each variant's **Variant ID** (visible in the product's URL or via
   **Store → Products → (product) → Variants**) — you'll need both in step 3.
3. On the Railway backend service, add these Variables:
   - `LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY` — **Settings → API** in Lemon Squeezy → **Create
     API key**. Goes directly into Railway, same as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
   - `LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID` — **Settings → Stores**, shown next to your
     store name.
   - `LEMONSQUEEZY_VARIANT_STARTER` / `LEMONSQUEEZY_VARIANT_PRO` — the two
     Variant IDs from step 2.
   - `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` — your deployed frontend's exact origin (e.g.
     `https://your-app.vercel.app`, no trailing slash) — Lemon Squeezy
     Checkout redirects back here after payment.
   - `BILLING_TRIAL_DAYS` — optional, defaults to `7`; keep in sync with
     step 2's dashboard setting (copy-only, doesn't control anything).
   - `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — from step 4 below (you'll come back to
     this).
4. **Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook** in Lemon Squeezy:
   - Callback URL: `https://your-backend.up.railway.app/api/v1/billing/webhook`
   - Signing secret: type in your own secret string here (Lemon Squeezy
     doesn't generate one for you like Stripe does) — then set that same
     value as `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Railway (step 3) and
     redeploy.
   - Events to send — select exactly these eight (the app ignores everything
     else, but only select what you need):
     `subscription_created`, `subscription_updated`,
     `subscription_cancelled`, `subscription_resumed`,
     `subscription_expired`, `subscription_paused`,
     `subscription_unpaused`, `subscription_payment_failed`.
5. Smoke test billing specifically: sign up a test account through your live
   frontend, go through onboarding, land on **Billing**, pick a plan, and
   complete Checkout while the store is still in **Test mode** (Lemon
   Squeezy's [testing docs](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/getting-started/test-mode)
   cover the test card to use). You should land back on `/app/billing` and
   the dashboard should unlock within a few seconds (it's waiting on the
   webhook, not the redirect, to actually flip the switch). Once you're
   confident it works, flip the store out of Test mode in Lemon Squeezy
   before sending it to real customers.

## 5. Smoke test

Once both are live:
- Visit the frontend URL, sign up a real account, run through onboarding, and
  confirm the dashboard loads — this exercises the full stack (frontend →
  backend → Postgres) in one pass.
- Check the backend URL's `/health` and `/ready` directly in a browser — both
  should return `200`.
- If signup fails with a network/CORS-looking error, the almost-certain cause
  is `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` not exactly matching the frontend's origin
  (scheme + host, no trailing slash) — check step 3.

## Known limitation carried over from local dev

The in-memory rate limiter (`src/api/rate_limit.py`) is process-local — fine
for a single Railway instance (the default), but if you ever scale the
backend to more than one instance, it needs to be replaced with a shared
limiter first (see the root `README.md`'s "What's still not wired" section).
Not a blocker for launch, just don't turn on multiple replicas without
revisiting this.
