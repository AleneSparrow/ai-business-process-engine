    Local dev servers are commonly started against a Postgres instance whose
    schema has drifted behind the latest migration in the repo (a new
    milestone adds tables the running database doesn't have yet), which
    otherwise surfaces as an opaque 500 on the first request that touches
    the missing table. Running `alembic upgrade head` is a no-op when the
    schema is already current, so this is safe to attempt on every startup.

    Deliberately restricted to app_env == "development": test fixtures build
    their own schema directly via `Base.metadata.create_all` against an
    isolated database and must not have this reach for `DATABASE_URL` from
    the environment instead, and production schema changes should be a
    reviewed, explicit deploy step rather than an implicit side effect of
    process startup.
