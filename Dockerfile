# Run as a non-root user. The image had no USER directive, so the container
# ran everything as root -- a remote-code-execution bug anywhere in the app
# would have started with root inside the container instead of an account
# that owns nothing. Port 8000 is above 1024, so binding it needs no
# privilege.
#
# The user is created BEFORE the source is copied, and the copy is chowned to
# it, so that `docker compose run --rm app python -m pytest` can still write
# /app/.pytest_cache. Under root that was free; under appuser a root-owned
# /app would make pytest warn on every run about a cache it cannot create.

# ${PORT:-8000} instead of a hardcoded port: hosting platforms that assign
# ports dynamically (Railway, Render, Fly.io) inject PORT and expect the
# process to bind to it; local `docker compose up` doesn't set PORT, so it
# falls back to 8000 exactly as before.
#
# `alembic upgrade head` here is the LOCAL-DEV mechanism: docker-compose.yml
# overrides no command, so this is what migrates a fresh local database. On
# Railway it is a no-op, because railway.toml's preDeployCommand has already
# brought the database to head once, before any container starts -- see the
# comment there. That ordering is what makes more than one replica safe:
# without it, every replica would race to run the same migration on boot,
# and with restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3 a replica that lost the race could
# fall out of the deploy. An upgrade with nothing left to apply only reads
# alembic_version, so running it in both places costs nothing.
